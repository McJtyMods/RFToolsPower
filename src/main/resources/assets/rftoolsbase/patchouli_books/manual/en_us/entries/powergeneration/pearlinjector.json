This machine provides the only way to inject an ender pearl into the power system. When it receives a redstone signal it will convert the ender pearl to an endergenic pearl and immediately insert it into the adjacent Endergenic Generator. If that generator was already holding a pearl then nothing happens and the pearl is lost"
